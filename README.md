Storing Values of Variable (Turbo C++)

Welcome to My SV Prototype!
The code is done for activity and works in Turbo C++ (TurboC7)

It's not actually storing Values of Variable for a variable can only hold one value
it's like when you wanted to have an add ons for an order or to order another.
It just Started the Idea to be able to Maintain Values of Variable while being able to complete our activity!

If ya found any issues or something, feel free to tell me!!!
If I was able to help atleast a bit I'll be glad ^ ^
